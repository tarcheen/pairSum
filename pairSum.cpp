In this program we want to find all pairs of numbers which sums to a total given. for example 
{4,1,-1,7,3}    total = 5
result = (4,1)

Note: you are not allowed to use the brute force way to calculate the pair since the complexity is O(n^2)

#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
    int arr[] = {1 ,5 ,7 ,-1 ,50 };
    int total = 6;
}
